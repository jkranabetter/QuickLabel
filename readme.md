## About

This is a quick labelling tool to assign images to different class folders using hotkeys. About 5 times faster than sorting by hand.

## Installation

```
pip install opencv-python
```

Put your unlabelled images in the **unlabelled** folder. If you dont already have labelled files, the program will create the labelled directory for you. If you have previously labelled files, put them in the **labelled** folder according to the directory stucture below.

## Directory Structure
```
├── labelled/
│   ├── -1
│   ├── 0
│   ├── 1
│   └── pending
└── unlabelled
